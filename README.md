# vue-essentials

This was a project that I did following a LinkedIn Learning course 'Vue Essentials.'

I created a basic clothing store where I took data from an API and designed a shopping page & a checkout page.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
